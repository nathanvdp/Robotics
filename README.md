We present a gesture controlled Pachinko game with auto-mated ball return. Using hand gestures players try to catch a ball witha cup. If the ball is not caught it is returned automatically to the top ofthe board using a lift. The system is build using two one-axis sliders, anUltraLeap, a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Uno

start to loop up and down. It's important to start with the pplatform being at
the lowest possible position.
